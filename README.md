zip file "project" contains the source code for running the game, defaulted with two random players playing the game. This file is given by instructor.

zip file "submission" - src - student player contains my version of student player, implemented minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning technique. Replace the student player folder in project with the one in submission, would make my player playing against random/greedy player as well as other customed player.
